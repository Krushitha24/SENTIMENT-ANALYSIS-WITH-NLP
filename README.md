# This project is about finding out how customers feel about a product or service by looking at what they write in their reviews. Instead of reading every review one by one, we use a computer program to do it automatically. The main goal is to understand if people are happy, unhappy, or just neutral based on the words they use in their reviews. The data for this project comes from a file called customer_reviews.csv, which has many customer comments.

# The first step in the project is to clean up the reviews so the computer can understand them better. This means removing things like punctuation, changing all letters to lowercase, and taking out common words like “the” or “and” that don’t add much meaning. Once the text is cleaned, we use a tool or model to check the emotion behind each review. For example, if someone says “I love this product,” it is marked as positive. If someone writes “This is terrible,” it is marked as negative.

# After checking the emotions of all the reviews, we use graphs and charts to show the results. For instance, we can make a pie chart to see how many reviews are positive, negative, or neutral. We can also look at changes over time to see if customers were happier or less happy during certain months.

# In the end, the project gives us useful information about what customers think. If many people are saying good things, that’s a good sign. If there are lots of bad reviews during a certain time, the company can look into what went wrong. Overall, this project helps businesses understand their customers better and make improvements where needed. It saves time and gives a clear picture of customer opinions by using smart tools and simple analysis.
